# Meeting Room Remover

Meeting Room Remover is a Slackbot that allows users to remove meeting rooms from their events in Google Calendar when they are not in the office.

If the user has any meeting rooms booked for today AND she has not logged into Slack from the office IP address, the bot sends a message to the user. When the user clicks on a button, the bot removes the meeting room from the event.
